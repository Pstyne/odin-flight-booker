# Project: Flight Booker

Build a one-way flight booking service with a checkout process

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information (Maybe later)

Originally I wanted to implement billing for the flight but I feel like I've spent enough time
fulfilling the step-by-step guide drained enough time and provided enough learning that I've decided
to leave the project as it is for now.

After plugging away at the accepts_nested_attributes_for method for hours the current result of the
application was satisfactory for me.

This is the last project in the section before moving to the final section of the [Ruby on Rails course
of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms)
