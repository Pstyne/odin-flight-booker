# Project: Flight Booker

Build a one-way flight booking service with a checkout process

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

My goal is to integrate Stripe into this application so users could theoretically book a flight
though it won't actually charge anyone using a test key, right?

This is the last project in the section before moving to the final section of the [Ruby on Rails course
